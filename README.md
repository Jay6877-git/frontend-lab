# Frontend Practice Projects

A collection of my HTML/CSS practice projects. These are static sites built to improve my skills and will eventually include responsive layouts and more advanced designs.

## Projects

- **Devis Burger**: A simple landing page layout for a burger shop.
- **Recipe Page**: A structured recipe display with nutritional info.
- **Rise of Soccer**: A thematic page about soccer history.
- **Survey Form**: Basic styled form layout.
